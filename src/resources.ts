export const SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = `RPG Maker XP project editor. These tools read and write a project's RGSS1 Marshal .rxdata directly (actors, skills, items, maps, events, scripts) and render PNG previews.

GOVERNANCE — these tools are the single sanctioned path for edits; they enforce the engine's invariants so the project doesn't drift:
- Before external writes, save your own editor changes and use File > Close Project. The application may remain open; a running RPGXP.exe alone does not prove that a project is loaded. After writes finish, use File > Open Project (Ctrl+O) to reopen Game.rxproj. Never automatically save or discard unsaved editor changes. Saving a stale loaded project can overwrite external changes. The server keeps versioned backups and bumps System.magic_number on map writes.
- Use the create_* tools (they mirror the editor's default constructors, so new content is canonical). Don't hand-edit .rxdata.
- Run validate_assets before shipping to catch broken graphic/audio references.

AUTHORING MAPS — FIRST call get_map_design_guide (or read the "map-design" resource). Key rules:
- TILE MEANING FIRST: render_tileset_atlas is only a numeric reference. For an uncataloged tileset, run create_tileset_identification_harness, review source adjacency and multi-tile objects, save the semantic catalog, and validate it before automatic composition.
- SIZE FIRST: a map is N screens of 20x15 tiles. Pass create_map a "purpose" (interior/room/town/dungeon/region/overworld) to default the size, and design to the returned size_advisory (~1 focal point per screen-region + a path network). Use get_map_size_advisory when editing. Engine limits 20x15..500x500.
- Layers (Map.data z, drawn z0->z1->z2 = editor Layer 1/2/3) are assigned by ROLE: z0 terrain (paint with apply_autotile for seamless edges); z1 ground clutter (priority 0: flowers, bushes, rocks); z2 overhead (priority > 0: tree canopies, roofs — player walks behind).
- NEVER overlap two multi-tile objects (trees, houses) on the same layer — set_map_tiles overwrites and they clip; space landmark objects.
- Use the tileset catalog for creator-facing meaning, render_tileset_atlas for quick numeric lookup, and render_map to verify composition (it is a FLAT composite — open the editor to confirm overhead occlusion).

Full guidance is available as resources: map-design (level design), tileset-catalog (tile identification), authoring (XP particularities + anti-drift governance), wisdom (engine internals).`;
