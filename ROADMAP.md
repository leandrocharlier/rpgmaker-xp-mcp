# Proposed tileset tools

These proposals are not implemented or advertised as available tools.

- Read-only collection analysis: report unused image regions, exact duplicates,
  compatible tile-property groups, and possible packing improvements. Keep
  recommendations separate from mutations and report uncertain usage from scripts.
- `compact_used_tileset`: collect tiles used by maps and tile-based event graphics,
  preserve autotiles and passage/priority/terrain properties, and propose a compact
  atlas. Deduplicate only when pixels and relevant properties are compatible.
  Preview the full remapping first; applying must back up and atomically stage
  the image, database, maps, and event references with conflict detection and
  rollback. Verify on synthetic projects that unrelated data stays unchanged.

Neither proposal should change the conservative suffix-only behavior of
`truncate_unused_tilesets`.
